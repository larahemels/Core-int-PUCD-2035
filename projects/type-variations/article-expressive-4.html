      <h3>Karel Martens on paying attention to the things we don’t see</h3>
      <h3>By Jyni Ong</h3>
    </section>
      <section class="article">
        <P>He may be 81 years old, with a career spanning 60 years and counting, but Karel Martens is still of the mindset that his work can always be better. It’s what drives the self-professed workaholic, he tells us over a video call, and it’s the reason he’s updated his historic monograph several times. Originally published back in 1996, the monograph was an instant classic in its extensive survey of the prolific graphic designer’s career. As well as co-founding the two-year master’s programme at Werkplaats Typografie, with Wigger Bierma in Arnhem, Karel, a central figure in the Dutch modernist movement, seems to have designed it all. Throughout his impressive career he has turned his hand to stamps, coins and films – not to mention every other graphic design staple, from books to corporate identities.</P>

  <section class="article-2">
        <P>For Karel, however, the latter process is more difficult. “I discovered everything through reflecting. There can be a lot of rules in the game,” he says on the act of designing, “but you have to order them and kind of sort them out. I think limitation is an important thing.”</P>

<P>Present technology erases many of the limitations that were present in the pre-Adobe design era. But for Karel, it’s imperative to remember that graphic design was born out of restriction; restriction of what the hands can do with print. So the fundamentals of the art remain much the same for this new era. The process of graphic design can be boiled down to this question posed by Karel: “How many different elements do you need to tell the story?”</P>

  </section>
  <section class="article-3">
        <P>He’s just as much a teacher as he is a designer in the field. And this is where his remarkable breadth of knowledge comes in handy. Confident in his own opinions and values, as a teacher, Karel prefers to guide students rather than “teach them things” in the definitive sense. It’s a philosophy Werkplaats Typografie was founded on: to guide. If he sees a student who is always making the same kind of thing, perhaps avoiding a certain element of their practice, Karel will say “why not, that’s one of the qualities of your voice. Nice voices don’t necessarily have to be perfect.”</P>

        <P>The story doesn’t have to be 100 per cent accurate</P>
