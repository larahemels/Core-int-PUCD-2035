      <h1>“Absence in design is very important”</h1>
      <h2>Karel Martens on paying attention to the things we don’t see</h2>
      <h3>By Jyni Ong</h3>

      <section class="article">
        <P>He may be 81 years old, with a career spanning 60 years and counting, but Karel Martens is still of the mindset that his work can always be better. It’s what drives the self-professed workaholic, he tells us over a video call, and it’s the reason he’s updated his historic monograph several times. Originally published back in 1996, the monograph was an instant classic in its extensive survey of the prolific graphic designer’s career. As well as co-founding the two-year master’s programme at Werkplaats Typografie, with Wigger Bierma in Arnhem, Karel, a central figure in the Dutch modernist movement, seems to have designed it all. Throughout his impressive career he has turned his hand to stamps, coins and films – not to mention every other graphic design staple, from books to corporate identities.</P>

<P>Flicking through his monographs provides a tireless flow of inspiration, including most recently the one published on the cusp of 2020 by Roma Publications. Featuring an open Japanese bind and double-sheeted spreads, this most recent monograph is different to its predecessors for its play with borders, as Karel puts it, an interesting area “where two worlds meet”. A philosophical interpretation for someone more renowned for their technical, more specifically typographic precision. Beyond this distinction with borders, however, which Karel has designed “as close to the edge as possible”, and beyond the visual impressiveness of each comprehensive spread, Re-Printed Matter remains resolute in its detail and beauty. It’s also a testament to Karel Martens’ unyielding and ever-curious approach to creativity.</P>
<p class="pull-quote">“Making work is “all about trying and discovering” and in his opinion, “there are no truths.”</p>
<p>There is nothing negative associated with the mistake for Karel. It may be a cliché, but the proof is in the pudding. He’s someone who views no difference between artist and designer (just the label) and through his unique way of seeing, creativity is “all about the person”. By this, he means that creativity is the antithesis of dogma. Making work is “all about trying and discovering” and in his opinion, “there are no truths.” He uses the example of a garden. When creating a garden, the common law dictates that the big plants go at the end and the small ones in front. But what if the other way around is more interesting?</p>
<p>Karel isn’t afraid of stepping out his comfort zone, no matter what stage of life. His ability to introduce a new medium by looking at an image from a different angle is just one of the many reasons why his portfolio to date is so diverse. When Karel first launched his career after studying fine art at the Arnhem Academy of Art and Industrial Arts in 1961, the industry was completely different to the screen-based discipline it is today. Back then, he would hand draw type as small as point sizes eight or nine. A far cry from the technological simplicity of today, when you hit a button and a letter appears before you.</p>
<p>For Karel, however, the latter process is more difficult. “I discovered everything through reflecting. There can be a lot of rules in the game,” he says on the act of designing, “but you have to order them and kind of sort them out. I think limitation is an important thing.”</p>
<p>Present technology erases many of the limitations that were present in the pre-Adobe design era. But for Karel, it’s imperative to remember that graphic design was born out of restriction; restriction of what the hands can do with print. So the fundamentals of the art remain much the same for this new era. The process of graphic design can be boiled down to this question posed by Karel: “How many different elements do you need to tell the story?”</p>
<p>The story doesn’t have to be 100 per cent accurate, though. The designer can “lie a bit” or cut corners in the information they hold back from the viewer. That’s also part of the script – don’t tell the total story so the viewer can hook onto the missing details. In graphic design, the work is outward-facing, for the public.</p>
<p class="pull-quote">“Curiosity is a very important thing for a human being. If you see a book on the shelf, you should become curious. Absence in design is very important, the things you don’t see. But designers can offer a set of ingredients and allude to certain things.”</p>
<p>He’s just as much a teacher as he is a designer in the field. And this is where his remarkable breadth of knowledge comes in handy. Confident in his own opinions and values, as a teacher, Karel prefers to guide students rather than “teach them things” in the definitive sense. It’s a philosophy Werkplaats Typografie was founded on: to guide. If he sees a student who is always making the same kind of thing, perhaps avoiding a certain element of their practice, Karel will say “why not, that’s one of the qualities of your voice. Nice voices don’t necessarily have to be perfect.”</p>
<p>Teaching is “a kind of broad way of gaining information,” he says, explaining that learning is a two-way street between pupil and professor. Every autumn (with the exceptio
n of 2020, given the pandemic), Karel usually journeys to New York to lecture at Yale School of Art. He notes the multiculturalism of the student population – people from all over the world, from differing cultures and backgrounds too. And when such a wide-ranging group gathers together in one place, “you can learn a lot.” It goes back to his quintessential view that curiosity is key, as now, for a man who has done so many wonderful things and inspired so many people, he concludes: “I’m regretting more of the things that I didn’t do in my life than the things that I did.”</p>
