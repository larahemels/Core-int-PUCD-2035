      <h2>“Absence in design is very important”</h1>
      <h3>Karel Martens on paying attention to the things we don’t see</h2>
      <h4>By Jyni Ong</h3>

      <section class="article">
        <P>He may be 81 years old, with a career spanning 60 years and counting, but Karel Martens is still of the mindset that his work can always be better. It’s what drives the self-professed workaholic, he tells us over a video call, and it’s the reason he’s updated his historic monograph several times. Originally published back in 1996, the monograph was an instant classic in its extensive survey of the prolific graphic designer’s career. As well as co-founding the two-year master’s programme at Werkplaats Typografie, with Wigger Bierma in Arnhem, Karel, a central figure in the Dutch modernist movement, seems to have designed it all. Throughout his impressive career he has turned his hand to stamps, coins and films – not to mention every other graphic design staple, from books to corporate identities.</P>

<p class="pull-quote">“Making work is “all about trying and discovering” and in his opinion, “there are no truths.”</p>
<p>There is nothing negative associated with the mistake for Karel. It may be a cliché, but the proof is in the pudding. He’s someone who views no difference between artist and designer (just the label) and through his unique way of seeing, creativity is “all about the person”. By this, he means that creativity is the antithesis of dogma. Making work is “all about trying and discovering” and in his opinion, “there are no truths.” He uses the example of a garden. When creating a garden, the common law dictates that the big plants go at the end and the small ones in front. But what if the other way around is more interesting?</p>
<p>Karel isn’t afraid of stepping out his comfort zone, no matter what stage of life. His ability to introduce a new medium by looking at an image from a different angle is just one of the many reasons why his portfolio to date is so diverse. When Karel first launched his career after studying fine art at the Arnhem Academy of Art and Industrial Arts in 1961, the industry was completely different to the screen-based discipline it is today. Back then, he would hand draw type as small as point sizes eight or nine. A far cry from the technological simplicity of today, when you hit a button and a letter appears before you.</p>
<p>The story doesn’t have to be 100 per cent accurate, though. The designer can “lie a bit” or cut corners in the information they hold back from the viewer. That’s also part of the script – don’t tell the total story so the viewer can hook onto the missing details. In graphic design, the work is outward-facing, for the public.</p>
<p class="pull-quote">“The story doesn’t have to be 100 per cent accurate.”</p>
<p>He’s just as much a teacher as he is a designer in the field. And this is where his remarkable breadth of knowledge comes in handy. Confident in his own opinions and values, as a teacher, Karel prefers to guide students rather than “teach them things” in the definitive sense. It’s a philosophy Werkplaats Typografie was founded on: to guide. If he sees a student who is always making the same kind of thing, perhaps avoiding a certain element of their practice, Karel will say “why not, that’s one of the qualities of your voice. Nice voices don’t necessarily have to be perfect.”</p>
<p>Teaching is “a kind of broad way of gaining information,” he says, explaining that learning is a two-way street between pupil and professor. Every autumn (with the exceptio
n of 2020, given the pandemic), Karel usually journeys to New York to lecture at Yale School of Art. He notes the multiculturalism of the student population – people from all over the world, from differing cultures and backgrounds too. And when such a wide-ranging group gathers together in one place, “you can learn a lot.” It goes back to his quintessential view that curiosity is key, as now, for a man who has done so many wonderful things and inspired so many people, he concludes: “I’m regretting more of the things that I didn’t do in my life than the things that I did.”</p>
